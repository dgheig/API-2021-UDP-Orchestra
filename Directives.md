# Teaching-HEIGVD-API-2022-Labo-Orchestra

## Admin

- **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
- It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**.
- We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.
- ⚠️ You will have to send your GitHub URL, answer the questions and send the output log of the `validate.sh` script, which prove that your project is working [in this Google Form](https://forms.gle/6SM7cu4cYhNsRvqX8).

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

- The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

- The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

- The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

- Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.

## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

- the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

- the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound       |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`  |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`     |
| `flute`    | `trulu`     |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`   |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum` |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

- The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
- After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab

You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 5 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```

When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.

# Tasks and questions

Reminder: answer the following questions [here](https://forms.gle/6SM7cu4cYhNsRvqX8).

## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
|          | _Insert your diagram here..._                                |
| Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**?         |
|          | The `musician` services will send a datagram periodicaly, e.g. each 2 seconds, that acts as a [heartbeat signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)). The ideal interval should be defined based on many criteria: How long can a node not respond? After how long is it considered dead? ... |
| Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
|          | The `auditor` services will receive the datagrams. It will memorize the received data per emitter who are identified using an uuid.<br />Any data, unless renew, will be deleted after a given period, e.g. after 5 seconds. |
| Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams?         |
|          | The `UUID` of the `musician` , the instrument it is playing and since when. |
| Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
|          | An object to represent a `musician` on the server side and a Map on the client side to easily handle the unicity of data per musician.<br />The musician data are stored once at the beginning of the musician service.<br />The Map will store both the received data and the timestamp at which the data was received. Periodicaly, each data that wasn't renew on time is considered as sent by a stopped node and thus deleted.<br />The current state of the `auditor` service can be retrieved any time. |

## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
|          | We can use the `JSON.stringify()` method.                    |
| Question | What is **npm**?                                             |
|          | Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for Node. |
| Question | What is the `npm install` command?                           |
|          | This command resolve the dependencies of the requested packages and downloads them onto the local machine. |
| Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?        |
|          | This is npm's "hub". It allows us to search for any published package. This provides many useful and valuable informations as: ranking (e.g. popularity), license, dependecies AND dependents, versions, external links (github, documentation, ...) |
| Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122? |
|          | We can use the ` v4` function from the `uuid` package.       |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis? |
|          | We can use the `setInterval()` function and specify the period in milliseconds |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**?               |
|          | By first creating a `dgram` socket and using the `send()` method |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**? |
|          | We can access them by using the `process.argv` array.        |

## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?         |
|          | The simpliest way is to define our image configuration in a Dockerfile, using an existing node image as a basis and adding our sources to the image. Once the `Dockerfile` defined, we can build our image using `docker [image] build` command. |
| Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile? |
|          | `ENTRYPOINT` specifies the command (executable + default parameters) that will be run on container launch. There are 2 syntaxes:<br />Exec form (recommanded): `ENTRYPOINT [command, arg1, arg2,...]`<br />Shell form: `ENTRYPOINT command arg1 arg2 ...` |
| Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**? |
|          | `docker [container] run <image_name>`. Nb: it is recommanded to use the complete version over the shorthand one. |
| Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?        |
|          | `docker container ls` or `docker ps`. Nb: the first version is the recommanded one; the second one exists for historical reason and shouldn't be used, for example, in scripts. |
| Question | How do we **stop** and **kill** one running container?       |
|          | `docker [container] stop [<container_id>|<container_name>]` to stop the container |
|          | `docker [container] kill [<container_id>|<container_name>]` to kill the container |
| Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams? |
|          | If there are logs, we can check the docker logs. In case where the container runs in the background, we can use the `docker [container] logs [-f] <container_name>` command.<br />Otherwise, since our `musician` services are sending on multicast ip, we can simply listen to the multicast ip with another service:<br />1. Join the multicast group (e.g. on linux `sudo smcroutectl join eno1 239.255.22.5`)<br />2. Start listening (e.g on linux `netcat -vv -l -u 239.255.22.5 5000`) |

## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group? |
|          | We need to:<br />- Add yourself in the multicast group. This is done using `addMembership` method<br />- Start listening to the mutlicast ip. This is done using `bind` method. |
| Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**? |
|          | A Map **is** a dictionnary. We can use it to ensure unicity of data per emitter using the musician's uuid as the key. |
| Question | How can we use the `Day.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting? |
|          | This would help us handling the dates in our program. For example to check the time elapsed since we received a given payload.<br />There is not much to handle regarding the dates, the built-in `Date` object and its `now()` methods are enough for this project. |
| Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**?          |
|          | There are many ways to do so. Each method checks the time elapsed and, if bigger than a threshold, remove it from the active musician list. This can be done:<br />- With a periodic check (using `setInterval`): This needs more computation but ensure the data to be as small as possible. The clients asking for the active musician won't wait.<br />- On demand: We filter the list once it is requested. This is better when there are only a few musician inactive musicans and a lot of changes between the requests. |
| Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?       |
|          | We can use the `net` package to create a server object using the `createServer()` method and start listening to the ip and port. |

## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #        | Topic                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image? |
|          | _Enter your response here..._                                                        |

## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

- the Docker image names
- the names of instruments and their sounds
- the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

### Validation

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should **try to run it** to see if your implementation is correct. When you submit your project in the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/6SM7cu4cYhNsRvqX8), the script will be used for grading, together with other criteria.
